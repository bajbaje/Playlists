This is Flask project for a web page, where you can add new songs to both your and community playlists.
The project includes parsing from Billboards Hot 100 hits, fully functional Sign Up and Log In forms and
two sqlalchemy databases: one of which keeps information about the user, and other one about the playlists
which users have created. There is also a special html for error 404, using a Flask function
